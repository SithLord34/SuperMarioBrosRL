we need to preprocess the game date before we use reinforcement learning, 
there are mainly 2 preprocesing steps:-
1) Greyscaling 
2) framestacking (screen shot taken)
as the color image has three times the many pixels to process and converting them into greyscale cuts down the data it needs to learn from 
framestacking helps our AI have context by stacking consecutive frames we are giving our AI model memory, it will be able to see mario and 
its enemy's movements

for preprocessing :-
